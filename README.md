# RLStuff
A collection of me playing around with Reinforcement Learning and other stuff. See more on my [blog.](https://chengxi600.medium.com/)

## Environments
#### ROMS:
- ROMs of Atari games I've used in my code. Note that with the latest version of OpenAI's gym, you need to import ROMs manually to run Atari environments.
#### ContinuousCartPole
